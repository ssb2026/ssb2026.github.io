    <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides funding in support of science and engineering in the United States and represents approximately 25% of federal support to America's colleges and universities for basic research. The purpose of this special session is to provide SSB attendees with an overview of funding opportunities associated with the NSFâ€™s Division of Environmental Biology. The funding opportunities highlighted will span a range of career phases and include core programs within the Division of Environmental Biology and special programs targeted towards early-, mid-, and late-career principal investigators. Program Directors from the Division of Environmental Biology will present a summary of several funding opportunities, provide guidance on program-specific review criteria, and answer questions from participants. After the formal presentation, participants will have the opportunity to meet in small groups with NSF Program Directors and Staff to further discuss funding opportunities that are best aligned with their individual research programs.

    Depending on registration numbers, we may add a breakout session on funding opportunities for early-career (graduate student and postdoc) members.</p>
